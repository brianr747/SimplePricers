Conventions.txt

The main simplification used in this package is with regards to time: time
is a real variable, with one year corresponding to 1 unit on the time axis. Therefore,
the beginning of year 2000 is "2000.", and mid-2015 is "2015.5",

The second simplification is that interest rates are quoted using an annual compounding
convention. For example, a $1 investment compounded at "5%" for two years will have a value
$1 * (1.05) * (1.05). A 5% yield will be denoted as "0.05" in function inputs.

The only other yield conventions expected to be used will be for example purposes.
For example:
- A simplified semi-annual bond yield convention. This will only be used to illustrate how bond yield
  conventions operate.
- Simplified money market discount conventions.

Prices will be quoted as 100 = par value, and on a direy-price basis. Accrued interest will only
appear in examples illustrating how it works. Since most examples will be calculated on coupon dates,
accrued interest will not matter.
